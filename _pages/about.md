I am currently a Masters student at MIT CSAIL advised by [Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula](https://krrish94.github.io/) and [Antonio Torralba](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/torralbalab/). I completed my undergraduate at MIT in 2023.

My research focuses on building high-fidelity world models for intelligent systems. In particular, I am interested in combining implicit scene representations, foundation models, and algorithms to efficiently reconstruct, process, and manipulate 3D environments.
